The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on April 13, 1919, in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India, during the British Raj. It is one of the most infamous events in Indian history and a significant moment in the struggle for Indian independence. The massacre occurred when a British Indian Army unit, under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer, opened fire on a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians who had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh, a public garden, to participate in the traditional Baisakhi celebrations and to protest against British colonial rule. The firing lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including women and children, and injuring thousands more.The incident shocked the world and sparked outrage across India. It led to widespread condemnation of British policies in India and fueled the Indian independence movement. Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel laureate poet, renounced his knighthood in protest against the massacre, and Mahatma Gandhi began to advocate for nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving independence. The British government appointed the Hunter Commission to investigate the massacre, which ultimately held Dyer responsible for the excessive use of force but stopped short of labeling the incident as a massacre. However, Dyer was removed from his command and censured by the British Parliament. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre remains a painful and controversial chapter in Indian history, symbolizing the brutality of British colonial rule and the sacrifices made by those who fought for India's freedom. The site of the massacre, Jallianwala Bagh, is now a memorial and serves as a reminder of the struggle for independence and the need to uphold the principles of democracy and human rights.finally made Indians realise that their rulers were both barbaric and dangerous and their notions of justice did not apply beyond themselves. The monstrous event that occurred in a quiet garden in Punjab, inexorably, put us on the roadtowards that red letter day in 1947 when India bravely attained her freedom. Ninety-six yearsafter the massacre, Jallianwala Bagh remains the ultimate pilgrimage spot for nationalistIndians.Despite the massacre’s exceptional temporal singularity and the universal impulse tocommemorate, Jallianwala’s short life (less than 90 years) as a memorial and monumentalspace is complex and contradictory. Carefully considering these complexities andcontradictions, we encounter difficult questions about the representation of the past in thepresent. What exactly does the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial represent, stand for, and makeclaims on? How is the memorial used today, and how do these uses relate to the past?BACKGROUNDDuring World War I, British India contributed to the British war effort by providing men andresources. About 1.25 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and theMiddle East, while both the Indian administration and the princes sent large supplies of food,money, and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anti-colonialactivities. Revolutionary attacks in Bengal, associated increasingly with disturbances inPunjab, were significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration.3A pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army, planned for February 1915, was the mostprominent plan amongst a number of plots of the much larger Hindu–German Mutiny,formulated between 1914 and 1917 to initiate a Pan-Indian rebellion against the British Rajduring World War I. The revolutionaries included the Indian nationalists in India, the UnitedStates and Germany, along with help from the Irish republicans and the German Foreign Office
